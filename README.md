# Battleship
A text-based Battleship game written in Haskell.

Written for my final project for EECS 368: Programming Language Paradigms at KU.

## Running
In the project directory, run `cabal run`.

## Gameplay
**This game is best played in fullscreen.**

The gameplay should be pretty intuitive. The board is made up of many
characters, and here's what they mean:

- `W` - just water (hasn't been shot at)
- `B` - space with a ship on it
- `X` - hit
- `O` - miss
